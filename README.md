javascript project
I used in this project pure html , css and JavaScript.

The project includes five very important operations:
1- Creation (creating a new product)
2- Reading (this product was read and viewed by the site)
3- Update (updating and modifying this product)
4- Delete (Delete this product)
5- Search (possibility to search for a specific product)

And not only that, there is more:
- When creating a product, you can calculate the final cost of the product.
You can delete one product or delete all products at once
- You can search for the product by its name or by its type.
